Attempt with Python to recreate a simple batch least squares estimation from a ENGO 585 lab.

### **Bugs**
---
The stationary estimations seem good, but as soon as the positions start changing then the estimation goes wild and it doesn't follow the known path (right 50 m and then up 50 m)
will have to look into documentation further
